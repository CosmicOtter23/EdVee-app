Creating virtual environment:
C:\Users\lewis\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe -m venv venvName

Entering virtual environment (name=venv2):
(From EdVee directory)
..\venv2\Scripts\activate

Running webapp in debug mode (Windows):
$env:FLASK_APP = "run.py"
$env:FLASK_DEBUG = "1"

Creating database in python command line (C:\Users\lewis\OneDrive - University of Leeds\Edvee\EdVee-app\EdVee, file name = edvee.py, must be in venv):
from edvee import app, db
app.app_context().push()
db.create_all()
from edvee.models import User, Project, Element, Connection, Type, Access, Collection

Accessing the db to perform SQLite commands:
C:\Users\lewis\OneDrive - University of Leeds\Edvee\EdVee-app\EdVee> sqlite3 instance/site.db


Things to be included on EdVee app:
  (7) Export to PDF?
  Add a Collection table in database for users to store projects in
  Error when deleting things
  Fields in the element table are named incorrectly
  Inconsistent buttons
  Side menu doesn't work properly across different screen sizes
  X is in the wrong place on delete project popup
  Should see if project is editable from all projects page
  Add back button to project page
  Reset password functionality
  Clicking update from project gives 'Internal Server Error'

Done:
  Allow user to update their project from the update project page
  Make table rows clickable
  Make checkbox connect to the database (JQuery?) so users can check boxes to make connections
  Add all checkbox tables to the create_project page
  Values in update page stop getting mixed around when project is updated
  Click on an element to make edit box show up
  Connect lines between elements in tables
  1 Navigation - Jump between pairs etc, dashboard 
  2 Editing in dashboard to allow direct editing button e.g next to assessments
  Add nodes to be clicked instead of the whole box
  3 Allow Collaboration – levels of permission, share to edit, share to view
  4 Dotted lines to highlight meaning of linkages.  4 link full line  (dotted for - 3 link, 2 link, 1 link)
  6 Pop up boxes to show expanded text in dashboard – click ‘comment icon’ to show text? Popup covering the below data? If no, modal
  5 Flag  for no line at all – e.g. no connections. Vertical bar on edge of box?
  Colour the tables
  Only allow update project page to be accessed if the current user is the creator
  Give all permissions to creator of project
  Legend
  Automatically enter box when adding element
  All projects page should not be completely blank when there are no projects, maybe show a message
  Change the way a project is clicked to open the overview (button / whole box)

Questions:
Does a project need to be able to belong to more than one collection?
Would it be better to remove venv2 from the git repository and just use requirements.txt to gain all necessary packages?
