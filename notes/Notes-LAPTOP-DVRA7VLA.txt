Creating virtual environment:
C:\Users\lewis\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe -m venv venvName

Entering virtual environment (name=venv2):
cd "OneDrive - University of Leeds"/"Internship 2023"/Edvee-app/EdVee2
..\venv2\Scripts\activate

Running webapp in debug mode (Windows):
$env:FLASK_APP = "run.py"
$env:FLASK_DEBUG = "1"

Creating database in python command line (file name = edvee.py):
from edvee import app, db
app.app_context().push()
db.create_all()
from edvee.models import User, Project, Element, Connection, Type, Access


Things to be included on EdVee app:
7 Export to PDF?
Add a Collection table in database for users to store projects in
Legend
Automatically enter box when adding element
Error when deleting things

Done:
Allow user to update their project from the update project page
Make table rows clickable
Make checkbox connect to the database (JQuery?) so users can check boxes to make connections
Add all checkbox tables to the create_project page
Values in update page stop getting mixed around when project is updated
Click on an element to make edit box show up
Connect lines between elements in tables
1 Navigation - Jump between pairs etc, dashboard 
2 Editing in dashboard to allow direct editing button e.g next to assessments
Add nodes to be clicked instead of the whole box
3 Allow Collaboration – levels of permission, share to edit, share to view
4 Dotted lines to highlight meaning of linkages.  4 link full line  (dotted for - 3 link, 2 link, 1 link)
6 Pop up boxes to show expanded text in dashboard – click ‘comment icon’ to show text? Popup covering the below data? If no, modal
5 Flag  for no line at all – e.g. no connections. Vertical bar on edge of box?
Colour the tables
Only allow update project page to be accessed if the current user is the creator
Give all permissions to creator of project

Questions:
Is it better for the boxes to expand to fit the opposite boxes or be the same height? (See access test)
